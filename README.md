# hello-world
My first GitHub repository. I don't really know what I'm doing lol. Doesn't hold anything specific and that's exactly what this repository will be; a place to store files, thoughts, ideas, or random miscellaneous info that I don't really know where/how to organize. A notepad of sorts.
